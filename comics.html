                      What happens when your entire life is ruled by a prophecy - your future fortold by people you've never met, who died long before you were born. Such is the story of two young sea cretures. One believed to be a guiding light for his people, a Beacon who will lead them to a bright, proseprous future. The other is a teenage prince whose destiny is to kill the Beacon so that his own people might thrive. When both reject the course set for them, it leads them to a raucous adventure as big and unpredictable as the ocean itself - and a romance that nobody could have predicted.

                          Witness what the gods do...after dark. The friendships, the lies, the gossip, and the wild parties, and of course, forbidden love. Because as it turns out, the gods aren't so different from us after all, especially when it comes to their problems. Stylish and immersive, this is one of mythology's greatest stories -- The Taking of Persephone -- as it has never been told before.

                          Born into a world where everyone gets one murder a year, Kreyul learns at a younger age than most just how brutal this custom is. After the loss of his best friend, Kreyul swears to end this horrific practice forever. However, there are many who support the one-kill rule for their own selfish reasons, so his journey to change the hearts and minds of the five districts won't be an easy one.
